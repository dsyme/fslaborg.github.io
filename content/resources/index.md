Books and reports
-----------------

### [Analyzing and Visualizing Data with F#](http://fslab.org/report/)

_Tomas Petricek, O'Reilly, 2015_

[<img src="/img/report/cover.png" style="float:right;width:100px;margin:0px 30px 0px 30px" />](http://fslab.org/report/)

This report explains many of the key features of the F# language that make it a great tool 
for data science and machine learning. Real world examples take you through the entire data 
science workflow with F#, from data access and analysis to presenting the results. You'll learn about
FSharp.Data and type providers, the process of data analysis with Deedle and R type provider and
the implementation of basic machine learning algorithm with F#.

### [Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers](http://www.machine-learning-projects-for-dot-net-developers.com/)

_Mathias Brandewinder, Apress, 2015_

[<img src="/img/other/mlprojects.jpg" style="float:right;width:100px;margin:0px 30px 0px 30px" />](http://www.machine-learning-projects-for-dot-net-developers.com/)

The book shows you how to build smarter .NET applications that learn from data, using simple 
algorithms and techniques that can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems. You’ll 
code each project in the familiar setting of Visual Studio, while the machine learning logic 
uses F#, a language ideally suited to machine learning applications in .NET. If you’re new to 
F#, this book will give you everything you need to get started. If you’re already familiar 
with F#, this is your chance to put the language into action in an exciting new context.

Videos and conference talks
---------------------------

FsLab and using F# for data science and machine learning is a frequent topic at
large developer conferences including [Strata](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strataeu2014/public/schedule/detail/37395).
Here are some of the best talks that have been recorded.
